## Derivatives in R

Find the derivative of $$f(x) =5x^2$$

```{r}
ex_1 <- expression(5 * x ^ 2)
my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x")
my_derivative
```

#I want to find the slope at x = 2.8 #Create a sequence of values to evaluate multiple different integers for derivative.

```{r}
x <- 2.8
eval(my_derivative)
```

\#***Second method*** to find a derivative Find the slope of $g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$ D gives us a simple output

```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * z ^ 3 - 10.5 * z ^ 2 + 4.1 )

dg_dz <- D(gz, 'z')
dg_dz
```

#Evaluate the slope over a range of values

```{r}
z <- seq(from = -3, to = 4, by = 0.5)
eval(dg_dz)
```

Git Hub 
usethis::use_git()
Then appears as tab in rstudio. 
- Commit locally 
- Then push local files to github
